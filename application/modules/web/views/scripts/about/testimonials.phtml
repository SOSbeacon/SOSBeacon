Living alone she started unloading her groceries herself. Struggling with a heavy bag she slipped and fell hard on her hip…about 100 feet from her house. In terrible pain and unable to get herself up, she reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, activated the SOSBeacon “EMERGENCY” button and was in contact with 911 dispatchers. Because of the severe storm and multiple major accidents on the highway, 911 dispatchers told Betty that an ambulance would be delayed at least an hour.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a thousand miles away, Betty’s daughter Evelyn received a text and e-mail message from SOSBeacon, advising that her mother had called 911. Evelyn was able to access the SOSBeacon website and hear the recorded conversation between her injured mother and 911 dispatchers. Unable to help her mother herself, Evelyn called Jim, a neighbor of her mother’s, to ask for his help. When Jim answered Evelyn’s call, he was already on his way to help. Betty had her SOS Beacon’s “GOOD SAMARITAN” option activated on her phone and so did Jim, so he was notified of the 911 emergency call within his area. With the help of the locator map and recorded audio and images taken by Betty's phone, he knew exactly where and what help was needed. Within minutes of her fall, Betty was assisted into her home where she was able to stay warm until the ambulance arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">*** *** ***</p><p>88-year old Bernie and his 86-year-old wife Sharon have been married over 60 years. They’ve been living in our neighborhood for almost as long. Sharon has Parkinson's disease and extreme difficulty moving herself. She slipped to the floor and Bernie could not lift her onto her wheelchair. He pushed SOSBeacon on his phone and was immediately in contact with neighbors who had previously volunteered to provide help. Because we live next door and were available, we posted a note on Bernie's SOSbeacon alert webpage that we were on our way to help, saving duplicate effort. In less than ten minutes Sharon was back in her wheelchair.</p><p><strong>SOSbeacon for Schools:</strong></p>
<p>An electrical transformer malfunctioned, wiping out power to the entire neighborhood around Simone’s school. It would be 6-8 hours before electricity could be restored. All the classrooms were dark. For safety reasons school administrators needed to shut the school down and all the parents needed to be notified immediately…advising them that school is closing and to pick their kids up as soon as possible. Even though school phone lines and computers weren’t working, the school administrator’s cell phone worked as usual and an SOSbeacon alert to all the parents was broadcast, notifying Simone’s parents, and all the other parents at the same time, of the situation.</p><p>Simone’s parents are stuck in traffic on the other side of the bay and will be delayed picking up Simone. Using SOSbeacon's group collaboration features Simone’s parents were able to coordinate with other parents who could pick Simone up and babysit until her parents got home. The school was able to have the last child out the door within the hour and closed down for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">*** *** ***</p><p>The school bus bringing 5 year old Porter and his first-grade classmates from a field trip experienced a flat tire and was delayed an hour in returning to school. School administrators needed to quickly contact all the parents of the delayed children to advise them of the situation and schedule change. Using the school’s new SOSbeacon service, the principal, pushing a few buttons on her iPhone, was able to broadcast e-mail and text messages to all the parents instantly.</p><p>Porter’s mom received the alert with a link to the SOSbeacon Alert Message Board webpage where she checked in, read notes and comments and was able to monitor continuing information about the delay. Those parents who did not check in were contacted through SOSbeacon's automated robo-call system. With the comfort of having up to date information about the situation, Porter’s mom avoided the stress of the unknown and took advantage of the delay by running errands.</p>
