    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">About SOSbeacon.org</span><br>SOSbeacon.org is a non-profit organization that provides mobile phone and Internet services dedicated to saving lives, helping those in distress, reducing first response time and minimizing the anxiety of emergencies.</p>
	<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">SOSbeacon for Schools:</span><br>The old phone tree is not a very reliable way to get information to parents, especially in an emergency. Even email has its limitations in an emergency, but almost everyone now has a mobile phone that can receive both voice and text messages. SOSbeacon leverages these technologies to bring your school community together quickly. Use SOSbeacon's free school emergency contact database management system to easily create the groups you need to reach. Use SOSbeacon's group broadcasting services to get the word out to any or all groups with the push of a button on your mobile phone. SOSbeacon's service does not stop there, because as school administrator, you need both a method of monitoring, tracking and followup for contact responses and a tool for bringing a collaborative effort together within your community. SOSbeacon is designed to meet those needs.</p>
	<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">SOSbeacon for Families:</span><br>SOSbeacon makes you and your community more secure. Are you in distress?… Alert your community with data they can use to get you help. Are you available to help a neighbor in distress? … Set your phone’s Good Samaritan status to "on-line". By documenting details of an incident using its smartphone "eye-witness" recordings, SOSbeacon instantly provides information and collaborative communications to improve emergency response. SOSbeacon effectively mobilizes your community when you need it the most. <br></p>
